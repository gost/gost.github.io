Last August we travelled to Boston to visit the <a href="http://2017.foss4g.org/">FOSS4G conference</a> and give a workshop about SensorThings API and GOST.
See for full description of the workshop <a href "http://2017.foss4g.org/workshop-signup/#openModal-107">here</a>.

In a few hours, the participants were able to install, configure and visualize sensor information and learn more about SensorThings API, Docker, MQTT, HTTP, Postman and Node-RED.

The workshop material is available online so you can replay the workshop on your own time.
